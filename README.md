##Horiseon - Accessibility Standards Code Edit

##Description
I was hired to optimize Horiseon's site for search engines by editing its codebase to follow accessibility standards. This was done by creating semantic elements, connecting links, adding alt attributes and adjusting the CSS file. 

##Motivation
The motivation behind this project was to create a more streamline code and enhance the accessibility of the website

##HTML
div tags were changed throughout the code to semantic elements for ease of reading. Examples of tags added include header, nav, aside, footer, fig, figcaption and article.
Alt attributes were added to every image for accessibility reasons and for screenreaders
Corrected any not working links

##CSS
By cleaning up the div tags in the HTML doc, I was able to condense some of the CSS code so any future edits could be done more efficiently
